# F1 2021
<br>Hello! This is my very first website. It was designed when I was learning web development (HTML and CSS).
<br>At first it was a completely mess! Because I put every < tag > that I've learnt to see its effects.
<br>You will find two main sections:
<ul>
  <li>The main article (like a blog);</li>
  <li>The member's area (with login / register forms);</li>
 </ul>
<br>I'm still working on it. Here is a brief summary of the website evolution: 
<ul>
  <li> One subject only (F1 season 2021); Done ✔️</li>
  <li> Nav position and internal links; Done ✔️</li>
  <li> ⚠️Responsive layout (<strike>nav, body</strike>✔️ and images);⚠️ Not finished, I'm not sure why it isn't working on mobile mode;</li>
  <li> Member's area, user login and create account; Done ✔️</li>
  <li> JavaScript interaction:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> EventListener (i.e. Logo change while mouse hover); Done ✔️ </li>
    <li> Doc manipulation (i.e. User's opinion "Result"); Done ✔️ </li>
    <li> Manipulate CSS (coloring helmet at profile register); Done ✔️</li>
    <li> Build a JSON file to store information; Done ✔️ </li>
  </ul>
</ul>   
<br>And what I'm thinking to do:
<ul>
  <li> ⚠️Nav and aside menu layout; not definitive;</li>
  <li> 💭Flexbox / Grid Layout; not sure if / where / how it will be implemented;</li>
  <li> 🔜 Separate Login / Register sections; </li>
  <li> 🔜 Refactor the code using the JSON file; </li>
  <li> 🔜 User can say how many points he think it should be;</li>
  <li> 🔜 Favorite Team colors mode (like Dark / Light mode);</li>
<br> And for sure, we don't need to stop here.<br>
