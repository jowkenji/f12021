<br>Hello! This is my very first website. It was built when I was learning web development (HTML and CSS).
<br>As you can see, it's still a mess! Because I put every <tag> that I've learnt to see its effects.
<br>From now on, let's implement:
<br>
<br> - One subject only (F1 season 2021);
<br> - Responsive layout;
<br> - Flexbox / Grid Layout;
<br> - JavaScript interaction (Functions, OOP, EventListener, API, new feature: User "Fair Result");
<br>
<br>And for sure, we don't need to stop here.<br>
