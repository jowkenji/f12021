# F1 2021
<br>Hello! This is my very first website. It was built when I was learning web development (HTML and CSS).
<br>As you can see, it's still a mess! Because I put every < tag > that I've learnt to see its effects.
<br>From now on, let's implement:
<br>
<br> - <strike>One subject only (F1 season 2021)</strike>;
<br> - <strike>Nav position and internal links</strike>;
<br> - Responsive layout (<strike>nav, body</strike> and images); not sure why is not working on mobile;
<br> - <strike>Nav and aside menu layout</strike>; not definitive;
<br> - Flexbox / Grid Layout;
<br> - JavaScript interaction (Functions, OOP, EventListener, API, new feature: User "Fair Result");
<br> - <strike>Member's area, user login and create account</strike>;
<br>And for sure, we don't need to stop here.<br>
