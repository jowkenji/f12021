# F1 2021
<br>Hello! This is my very first website. It was built when I was learning web development (HTML and CSS).
<br>As you can see, it's still a mess! Because I put every < tag > that I've learnt to see its effects.
<br>From now on, let's implement:
<ul>
  <li> <strike>One subject only (F1 season 2021)</strike>;</li>
  <li> <strike>Member's area, user login and create account</strike>;</li>
  <li> <strike>Nav position and internal links</strike>;</li>
  <li> Responsive layout (<strike>nav, body</strike> and images); not sure why is not working on mobile mode;</li>
  <li> <strike>Nav and aside menu layout</strike>; not definitive;</li>
  <li> Flexbox / Grid Layout; (not sure if will be implemented);</li>
  <li> JavaScript interaction:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>new feature: User "Fair Result"</li>
    <li><strike>EventListener / manipulate CSS (coloring helmet)</strike>;</li>
    <li>Separate Login / Register sections;
  </ul>
</ul>
<br> And for sure, we don't need to stop here.<br>
