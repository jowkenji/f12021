# F1 2021
<br>Hello! This is my very first website. It was built when I was learning web development (HTML and CSS).
<br>As you can see, it's still a mess! Because I put every < tag > that I've learnt to see its effects.
<br>From now on, let's implement:
<ul>
  <li> One subject only (F1 season 2021); Done ✔️</li>
  <li> Member's area, user login and create account; Done ✔️</li>
  <li> Nav position and internal links; Done ✔️</li>
  <li> Responsive layout (<strike>nav, body</strike>✔️ and images); ⚠️ No finished, not sure why is not working on mobile mode;</li>
  <li> Nav and aside menu layout; ⚠️ not definitive;</li>
  <li> Flexbox / Grid Layout; 💭 not sure if will be implemented;</li>
  <li> JavaScript interaction:</li>
